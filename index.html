			<h2>Fill CapMan up with food, but don't give him too much or he'll explode!</h2>
			<p>Use the arrow keys to direct MaxCap around the level while he munches food.</p>
			<p>Keep an eye on him though, he tends to eat too much and go 'pop'! When it looks like MaxCap isn't feeling good, direct him to the toilet before he eats more food!</p>
			<p>Munch all the food on the level to get sent through to the next level.</p>
			<button>Got it!</button>
